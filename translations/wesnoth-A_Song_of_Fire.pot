"There are many among the Windsong who could successfully lead an army, or plan a battle, as the council has all children trained to the best of their ability. So, for the Windsong, knowing when to act is more important. The Raw is affected by all events, both past and future, and is fluidic as these possibilities change. Through her accompanying spirit, some Weavers learn to interpret flows in The Raw as predictions for future events. With time and experience, her predictions become more accurate and dependable. Eventually, if she is of quality, she will be invited to join the ranks of the Prophets. Unlike the farseers of other peoples, the Windsong Prophets do not 'witness' events so much as apply an expanded form of cause and effect. Knowing all flows are open to interpretation, Prophets are discouraged from making predictions without the council of her peers.\n"

"Unlike Envoys, Prophets have much time to study the arts of leadership and healing, and she has now learned to cure poison. Moreover, her increasing connection with nature has given her new powers not only over the spirits, but also over the plants."

Atargatis and her mermen's treatment of them was impeccable, but Myra noticed that her people's presence there was beginning to be a problem, since they were surviving almost exclusively on the natives' provisions. So, in their eighth day there, she ordered everyone to pack up their belongings and return to the ships. After thanking Atargatis for all the aid given them, and assuring her they'd meet again; Myra climbed on a sleeping volcano and marvelled humans, dwarves and mermen alike by dissipating the storm clouds with the power of the Trident. And so, bathed in sunlight for the first time in days, the refugees resumed their journey eastwards."
